# Fix "Invalid Grant Email Not Confirmed" Error

## The Problem
Your Netlify Identity account was created but the email confirmation step wasn't completed, so you can't login to the CMS.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Email
1. Look for a **confirmation email** from Netlify (check spam folder too)
2. If you find it, click the confirmation link
3. Complete the password setup process

### Step 2: If No Confirmation Email Found
**In your Netlify dashboard:**
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Identity** → **Users**
2. Find your email address in the users list
3. Click the **"..."** menu next to your user
4. Click **"Resend confirmation"**
5. Check your email again for the new confirmation link

### Step 3: Alternative - Delete and Re-invite
If confirmation emails aren't working:
1. In **Site settings** → **Identity** → **Users**
2. Delete your current user entry
3. Click **"Invite users"** 
4. Re-enter your email address
5. Check for the new invitation email
6. This time, complete the full signup process

### Step 4: Test Email Settings
**Check these settings in Identity:**
- **Registration preferences**: Should be "Open" or "Invite only"
- **Email templates**: Make sure they're enabled
- **External providers**: GitHub/Google can be used as alternatives

### Step 5: Browser-Based Workaround
1. Go to your live site: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. In the console, type: `window.netlifyIdentity.open('signup')`
4. Try creating a new account directly

## Alternative: Use GitHub Login
If email confirmation keeps failing:
1. In **Identity** → **External providers**
2. Enable **GitHub** 
3. Go to `/admin` and try "Login with GitHub"
4. This bypasses email confirmation entirely

## Once Successfully Logged In
- You'll be able to access `/admin`
- Edit all your content pages
- Changes will save directly to GitHub
- Your site will automatically rebuild

The key is getting that initial email confirmation completed!
