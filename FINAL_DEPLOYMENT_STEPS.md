# Final Steps to Fix Carousel Images

## ✅ Issue Identified and Fixed
The problem was that Netlify's build process wasn't copying your uploaded images from `client/public/assets/uploads/` to the final `dist/public/assets/uploads/` directory.

## ✅ Solution Applied
Updated `netlify.toml` with the correct build command:
```toml
command = "npm run build && cp -r client/public/assets/uploads dist/public/assets/uploads || true"
```

## 🔄 Final Action Required
**Push the updated `netlify.toml` file to your GitHub repository.**

This file contains the fix that tells Netlify to copy your images during the build process.

## What Will Happen Next:
1. **Push netlify.toml to GitHub** ← YOU NEED TO DO THIS
2. **Netlify automatically rebuilds** with the new build command
3. **Images get copied** to the correct location during build
4. **Carousel displays your uploaded images** on the live site

## Verification:
After the Netlify rebuild completes, these URLs should work:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02299.jpg`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02323.jpg`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02478.jpg`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02513.jpg`

And your carousel will display the actual images instead of placeholders.

## The Root Cause:
- ✅ Images uploaded correctly through CMS
- ✅ Content file updated with image paths  
- ✅ Carousel code working properly
- ❌ Build process wasn't copying images to deployment folder
- ✅ **Now fixed** with updated netlify.toml

Push that one file and your images will appear!
