# Fix for Netlify "Page Not Found" Error

## Problem
Netlify was looking for files in `dist/` but your build outputs to `dist/public/`

## Solution Applied
✅ **Updated netlify.toml**: Changed publish directory from `dist` to `dist/public`
✅ **Added _redirects file**: Proper routing for SPA and admin pages
✅ **Verified build output**: Files are correctly generated in `dist/public/`

## Updated Netlify Configuration

Your `netlify.toml` now has:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"  # ← Fixed: was "dist"
  command = "npm run build"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Push these changes to your GitHub repo**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Trigger a new Netlify build**:
   - Go to your Netlify site dashboard
   - Click "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
   - Or it should auto-deploy when you push to GitHub

3. **Verify the fix**:
   - Your site should now load properly
   - Test the `/admin` route for CMS access
   - API endpoints should work at `/api/*`

## What Was Fixed

- **Publish directory**: Now points to the correct build output location
- **Redirects**: Added proper routing for single-page app behavior
- **Admin routing**: CMS admin panel will load correctly at `/admin`
- **API routing**: Server functions will work at `/api/*`

Your site should now work perfectly on Netlify!
