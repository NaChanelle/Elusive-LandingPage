# Why Images Aren't Appearing - Deployment Issue

## The Problem
Your carousel image updates work locally in Replit, but they're not appearing on your live Netlify site because:

1. **Updated code is only in Replit** (not in your GitHub repository)
2. **Netlify builds from GitHub** (not from Replit)
3. **Your GitHub repo has the old carousel code** (that only shows placeholders)

## The Solution
You need to copy the updated files from Replit to your GitHub repository.

## Critical Files to Update in GitHub:

### 1. `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
The updated carousel code that displays real images instead of placeholders.

### 2. `client/public/assets/content/landing.json`
Your content file that the carousel reads from.

### 3. Build Configuration Files:
- `netlify.toml` (correct build settings)
- `_redirects` (proper routing)
- `client/index.html` (Netlify Identity widget)

## Step-by-Step Process:

### Option A: Manual File Copy (Recommended)
1. **Download these files from Replit:**
   - `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
   - `client/public/assets/content/landing.json`
   - `netlify.toml`
   - `_redirects`

2. **Upload to your GitHub repository** (same file locations)

3. **Netlify will auto-rebuild** with the new carousel code

### Option B: Direct GitHub Edit
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`
3. Edit the file and replace the carousel section with the updated code
4. Commit changes

## Once Updated:
✅ Your CMS image uploads will appear on the live site
✅ Carousel will show real images with professional overlay
✅ Fallback system works if images fail to load
✅ Auto-rotation every 4 seconds

The carousel functionality is working perfectly - we just need to get the updated code deployed to Netlify!
