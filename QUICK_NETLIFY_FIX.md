# Quick Fix for Your Netlify Deployment

## The Issue
Your Netlify site shows "Published" but displays a 404 because the configuration files aren't in your GitHub repository yet.

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Update Your GitHub Repository
You need to manually add these files to your GitHub repo:

1. **Copy the updated `netlify.toml`** (with `publish = "dist/public"`)
2. **Copy the `_redirects`** file 
3. **Commit and push to GitHub**

### Step 2: Files to Add/Update in GitHub

**netlify.toml:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

**_redirects:**
```
/api/*  /.netlify/functions/api/:splat  200
/admin/*  /admin/index.html  200
/*  /index.html  200
```

### Step 3: Force a New Deploy
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

## Why This Happened
Netlify builds from your GitHub repository, not from your Replit environment. The updated configuration files need to be in GitHub for Netlify to use them.

## Your Site Will Work After:
- ✅ GitHub has the updated netlify.toml
- ✅ GitHub has the _redirects file  
- ✅ Netlify rebuilds with the new config
- ✅ Your site loads at: https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app
- ✅ CMS works at: https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/admin
