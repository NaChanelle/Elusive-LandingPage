# Quick Fix for Carousel Images Not Appearing

## Current Status
✅ Images uploaded to CMS: `dsc02299.jpg`, `dsc02323.jpg`, `dsc02478.jpg`, `dsc02513.jpg`
✅ Content file updated with correct image paths
✅ Carousel code supports image display
❌ Images not appearing on live site

## Most Likely Issues:

### 1. GitHub Repository Missing Updated Files
Your GitHub repo might be missing:
- **Updated `client/public/assets/content/landing.json`** (with image paths)
- **Uploaded images in `client/public/assets/uploads/`** directory
- **Updated `client/src/pages/landing.tsx`** (carousel display code)

### 2. Cache Issues
Netlify or browser cache might be showing old version.

## Quick Solutions:

### Solution A: Verify GitHub Repository
1. Check your GitHub repo has:
   - `client/public/assets/uploads/dsc02299.jpg` (and other images)
   - Updated `landing.json` with image paths
   - Updated `landing.tsx` with image display code

### Solution B: Force Netlify Rebuild
1. Go to Netlify dashboard → Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Solution C: Test Image URLs Directly
Visit these URLs to verify images are accessible:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02299.jpg`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02323.jpg`

If images return 404, they weren't deployed to Netlify.

## Debug Steps:
1. **Check browser console** on your live site for any image loading errors
2. **Inspect carousel element** to see if image URLs are being generated
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload your site

The most common issue is that the images and updated content file haven't been pushed to GitHub yet.
