# Direct CMS Access Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ Your Netlify site is working
- ✅ Your email is confirmed (invite link works)
- ✅ You're authenticated with Netlify Identity
- → Need: Direct access to `/admin` without redirects

## To Access Your CMS

### Method 1: Direct URL Access
1. Go directly to: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/admin`
2. You should see the Decap CMS login screen
3. Login with your confirmed email and password

### Method 2: If Login Screen Doesn't Appear
1. Go to your main site first: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. In console, type: `netlifyIdentity.open('login')`
4. Login, then manually navigate to `/admin`

### Method 3: Fresh Browser Session
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Go to: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/admin`
3. Login with your credentials

## What Should Happen
Once you successfully access `/admin`, you'll see:
- Content collections for your pages
- Landing Page, Coming Soon, and Vessel editing options
- A "New Entry" or "Edit" interface
- All your existing content loaded and ready to edit

## If Still Having Issues
The most common remaining issue is browser cache. Try:
1. Clear your browser cache completely
2. Try a different browser entirely
3. Ensure you're using the exact URL: `/admin` (not `/admin/`)

Your CMS backend is properly configured and should work once you can access the admin interface directly.
