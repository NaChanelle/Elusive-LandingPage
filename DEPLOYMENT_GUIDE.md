# Complete Deployment Guide - Fix Carousel Images

## Current Status
‚ùå Images still not appearing because the critical fix hasn't been deployed to Netlify yet

## The Fix is Ready But Not Deployed
I've updated your `netlify.toml` file with the correct build command, but this file needs to be in your GitHub repository for Netlify to use it.

## What Netlify is Currently Using (Wrong):
```
command = "npm run build"
```

## What Netlify Should Use (Fixed):
```
command = "npm run build && cp -r client/public/assets/uploads dist/public/assets/uploads || true"
```

## Required Files to Update in GitHub:

### 1. netlify.toml (CRITICAL - This contains the fix)
Copy this exact content to your GitHub repository:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build && cp -r client/public/assets/uploads dist/public/assets/uploads || true"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/*"
  to = "/admin/index.html"  
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

### 2. Verification Steps:
1. Push the updated `netlify.toml` to GitHub
2. Wait for Netlify to rebuild (2-3 minutes)
3. Test image URLs directly:
   - Visit: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02299.jpg`
   - Should show your image, not 404

### 3. Expected Result:
- Carousel will display your uploaded images
- Images rotate automatically every 4 seconds
- Professional overlay with alt text and descriptions

## The Root Issue:
Your images are in GitHub, your carousel code is correct, but Netlify's build process isn't copying the images to the deployment folder because it's using the old build command.

Push the `netlify.toml` file and the images will work immediately.
