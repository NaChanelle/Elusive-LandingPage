# Exact Files to Copy to GitHub Repository

## ROOT LEVEL FILES:
- netlify.toml
- _redirects
- debug-netlify-identity.html

## CLIENT FILES:
- client/index.html (updated with Netlify Identity)
- client/public/admin/index.html (updated with authentication)
- client/public/admin/config.yml (already correct)
- client/public/admin/confirm.html (email confirmation helper)

## NETLIFY FUNCTIONS:
- netlify/functions/api.js (serverless functions)

Copy these files from your Replit to GitHub, then Netlify will auto-deploy with working CMS authentication.
