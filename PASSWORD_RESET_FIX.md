# Critical Deployment Issue - Images Not Deploying

## The Root Problem
Your images are in GitHub, but Netlify's build process isn't including them in the final deployment. This is likely due to:

1. **Build directory mismatch** - Netlify may not be using the correct publish directory
2. **Build process not copying assets** - The build isn't moving images to the output folder
3. **File path issues** - Images exist but aren't accessible at the expected URLs

## Immediate Fix Needed

### Update netlify.toml to ensure proper asset copying:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build && cp -r client/public/assets/uploads dist/public/assets/uploads"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/*"
  to = "/admin/index.html"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

### Alternative: Update package.json build script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist && cp -r client/public/assets/uploads dist/public/assets/ || true"
  }
}
```

## The Issue
Your build process creates `dist/public` but doesn't copy the uploaded images from `client/public/assets/uploads` to `dist/public/assets/uploads`, so they don't exist in the deployed site.

## Quick Test
After updating the build config, check if these URLs work on your live site:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/uploads/dsc02299.jpg`

If they return 404, the build process still isn't copying the images correctly.
