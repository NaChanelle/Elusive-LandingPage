# Fix for Netlify Identity Password Reset Issue

## The Problem
The password reset popup is being blocked by browser popup blockers, preventing you from completing your account setup.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Try Different Browsers (Quick Fix)
1. Open an incognito/private browser window
2. Go to your email and click the invitation link again
3. Try completing the password reset in the private window
4. If that doesn't work, try Safari, Firefox, or Chrome (whichever you're not using)

### Option 2: Use Direct URL Method
1. In your email invitation, right-click the "Accept Invitation" button
2. Copy the link address
3. Paste it into a new browser tab
4. This should bypass popup blockers

### Option 3: Reset Your Netlify Identity Setup
**In your Netlify dashboard:**
1. Go to Site settings → Identity → Users
2. Find your email and delete the user entry
3. Go to Site settings → Identity → Settings
4. Temporarily change registration to "Open"
5. Go to your live site: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app`
6. Look for a login widget or go directly to `/admin`
7. Click "Sign up" instead of using an invitation
8. Create your account with a new password
9. After successful signup, change registration back to "Invite only"

### Option 4: Browser Console Method
1. Go to your live site: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. In the console, type: `netlifyIdentity.open()`
4. This should force open the identity widget

## Updated Files
I've added the Netlify Identity widget to your main site pages so the login/signup process should work better. Once you get logged in once, future logins will be much smoother.

## Test Your Access
Once you successfully set your password:
1. Go to `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/admin`
2. Login with your credentials
3. You should see your CMS with all content ready to edit!

The CMS will save changes directly to your GitHub repository and automatically rebuild your site.
