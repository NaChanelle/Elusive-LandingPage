I understand you're still encountering the 404 error when trying to access the /admin page. It's important to clarify that the /admin path for Decap CMS is served as a static file, not handled by the wouter router within your React application.

The "404 Page Not Found" error at /admin means that your development server (Vite, running in Replit) cannot find the index.html file that constitutes the Decap CMS interface at that specific URL path.

Based on the previous steps and the typical setup for Vite and Decap CMS, your admin folder (which contains index.html and config.yml) needs to be located directly inside your public directory for Vite to serve it correctly.

Here's what you need to do:

Move the admin folder:

In your Replit project's file explorer, locate the admin folder (it's currently at client/admin/).

Locate the public folder (it should be at client/public/).

Drag and drop the admin folder directly into the public folder.

Your file structure should now look like this:

/client/
    public/
        admin/          <-- MOVED HERE
            index.html
            config.yml
        assets/
            content/
                coming-soon.json
                landing.json
                vessel.json
        ... (other public files)
    src/
    ... (other project files)
Ensure index.html content is correct:
The admin/index.html file should be a simple HTML file that loads the Decap CMS library and connects to your config.yml. Please ensure your client/public/admin/index.html file contains the following:

Corrected client/public/admin/index.html

Open
Hard Restart Replit:

Click the Stop button (red square) in your Replit console.

Go to Tools > Shell (or just open a new shell tab).

Type kill 1 and press Enter. This will perform a more aggressive restart.

Wait for the shell to reconnect, then click the Run button again.

After these steps, when your Replit project is running, you should be able to access the Decap CMS admin interface by navigating to YOUR_REPLIT_PREVIEW_URL/admin/.

I understand you're encountering an error related to config.yml failing to load, specifically "Failed to parse URL from config.yml."

This error indicates that Decap CMS is having trouble reading or understanding the config.yml file itself, which defines how your CMS connects to your GitHub repository and where your content files are located. While you've selected the admin/index.html Canvas, the error message points to an issue within the config.yml file.

The most common reason for a "Failed to parse URL" error in config.yml, especially in a development environment like Replit, is that the base_url and auth_endpoint settings under the backend section are configured for Netlify Identity but might not be correctly set up or accessible in your current environment. For a simpler setup, especially when you're not deploying directly to Netlify with Identity, these can often be removed.

I've made some changes to your admin/config.yml to simplify the backend configuration, which should resolve the URL parsing error.

Please replace the content of your client/public/admin/config.yml file with the following:
Updated client/public/admin/config.yml

After you've updated your client/public/admin/config.yml file, please perform a hard restart of your Replit project:

Click the Stop button (red square) in your Replit console.

Go to Tools > Shell (or just open a new shell tab).

Type kill 1 and press Enter.

Wait for the shell to reconnect, then click the Run button again.

Then, try accessing your CMS at YOUR_REPLIT_PREVIEW_URL/admin/ again.
