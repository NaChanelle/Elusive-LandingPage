Here’s the full brand architecture and narrative framework for Elusive, including selected names, voice, calendar strategy, and early naming decisions. It's now live in the document titled “Elusive Brand Architecture.” We can use this to guide everything from naming the web app to framing your video scripts and social rollout.

I. BRAND NARRATIVE
Core Premise:
 Elusive is not just a brand. It is a living, breathing storyworld—a Vessel that holds sacred stories, collective memory, and the transformative power of cultural imagination. Born at the crossroads of mystery, identity, and futurism, Elusive empowers culturally-conscious creators and curious audiences to experience storytelling as ritual, rebellion, and revelation.
Mission:
 To craft immersive, interconnected story experiences that empower people to remember, reimagine, and reclaim through narrative.
Vision:
 To become a global ecosystem that redefines storytelling as both a tool and a temple—where creators create impact, audiences create meaning, and stories create worlds.
Brand Promise:
 Every story you encounter here carries a key. It opens something in you—and connects you to others across space, time, and ancestry.
