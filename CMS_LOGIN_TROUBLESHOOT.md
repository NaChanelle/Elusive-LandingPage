# CMS Login Troubleshooting Steps

## Current Issue
Login to `/admin` is not working despite email confirmation being successful.

## Immediate Actions to Try

### 1. Force Deploy Updated Files
The authentication fixes may not be deployed yet:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Try accessing `/admin` again

### 2. Check Netlify Identity Status
In your Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Site settings → Identity
2. Verify these settings:
   - ✅ Identity is enabled
   - ✅ Registration is set to "Open" or "Invite only"
   - ✅ Git Gateway is enabled
   - ✅ Your email appears in the Users list

### 3. Test Authentication Directly
1. Go to your main site: `https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app`
2. Open developer tools (F12)
3. In the console, type: `netlifyIdentity.currentUser()`
4. If it returns your user object, you're logged in
5. If null, type: `netlifyIdentity.open('login')` to login

### 4. Alternative: Enable GitHub Login
1. In Netlify Identity → External providers
2. Enable GitHub
3. Try logging in with GitHub instead of email

### 5. Check Browser Issues
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- Clear all browser data for your site
- Try a different browser entirely

## What Should Work
Once authentication is working, at `/admin` you should see:
- Decap CMS interface
- "Website Pages" collection
- Landing Page, Coming Soon, Vessel entries ready to edit

## Debug Information Needed
If still not working, check browser console at `/admin` for error messages.
