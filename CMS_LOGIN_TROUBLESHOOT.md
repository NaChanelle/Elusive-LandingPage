# CMS Content Organization Guide

## Current CMS Structure:

### "Landing Page" Section (/platform page)
This manages content for: https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/platform
- Contains the carousel images you're looking for
- Event details and hero sections  
- Access tiers (Detective, Curator, Accomplice)
- FAQ section

### "Coming Soon Page" Section (/ homepage) 
This manages content for: https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/
- Main homepage content
- Countdown and launch information

## To Update Carousel Images:

1. **Go to CMS**: https://lighthearted-pony-bfe03b.netlify.app/admin
2. **Click "Website Pages"**
3. **Select "Landing Page"** (NOT Coming Soon Page)
4. **Scroll down to find "Carousel Images"** section
5. **Update image paths or upload new images**

## Current Carousel Images Location:
The carousel images field is correctly configured under "Landing Page" in the CMS and displays on the /platform URL.

If you're seeing carousel content under "Coming Soon", there might be a display issue in the CMS interface, but the data structure is correct.
