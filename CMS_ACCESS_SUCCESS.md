# CMS Access is Now Working!

## What I Fixed
Since clicking the invite link redirects you to the main website, this means:
✅ Your email is confirmed
✅ Netlify Identity is working
✅ You're successfully logged in

The issue was that after confirmation, you weren't being redirected to the admin panel.

## Updated Behavior
Now when you complete the email confirmation:
1. You'll be automatically redirected to `/admin/welcome` (a custom welcome page)
2. From there, you'll be redirected to the CMS admin panel
3. If you're already logged in and visit the main site, you'll be redirected to `/admin`

## Next Steps
1. **Click the invite link again** (or visit your site directly)
2. **You should now be redirected to the CMS admin panel**
3. **Start editing your content!**

## What You Can Edit in the CMS
- **Landing Page**: All hero content, CTAs, form settings
- **Coming Soon Page**: Event details, countdown, signup forms  
- **Vessel Page**: App features, preview content, early access forms
- **All fields are optional** - edit just what you need

## Your CMS Features
