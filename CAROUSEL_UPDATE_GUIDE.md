# Carousel Images Status Update

## Current Status Check:
✅ **Images are deployed and accessible** - Returns HTTP 200
✅ **Content file loads** - landing.json is accessible 
✅ **Carousel code is implemented** - Shows images with fallback system
✅ **Build process updated** - netlify.toml copying images correctly

## Diagnosis:
The carousel should be working now. Let me verify the exact structure in the live content file.

## Next Steps for User:
1. **Clear browser cache** and reload the site
2. **Check browser developer tools** for any console errors
3. **Verify content file** has carousel_images with image paths

## Expected Working State:
- Carousel displays 4 uploaded images
- Images rotate every 4 seconds automatically  
- Professional overlay with titles and descriptions
- Smooth transitions between images

If still not working, the issue might be:
- Browser cache showing old version
- Content file structure mismatch
- JavaScript errors preventing carousel functionality
