      "question": "What is Elusive, exactly?",
      "answer": "Imagine a world where mysteries don't just entertain but also spark conversations about identity and truth. Elusive is a hybrid mystery-meets-meaning storyworld that combines immersive films, live events, and interactive tools to create premium, multi-city experiences where your decisions and theories help uncover deeper narratives. Think \"Black Mirror\" meets scavenger hunt meets cultural archive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Elusive different?",
      "answer": "We create authentic cultural experiences that celebrate heritage through interactive storytelling, not just entertainment or aesthetics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a game or a show?",
      "answer": "Both—and neither. It's a living storyworld. You can watch it unfold, participate in real-world mysteries, or join the Investigator Circle to influence what happens next."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does it launch?",
      "answer": "Our first chapter begins August 2025. Early Investigators will get sneak previews, puzzle drops, and priority invites before the public."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to be in a certain city to participate?",
      "answer": "No! While we host IRL events, much of Elusive lives online. Investigators from anywhere in the world can explore, decode, and contribute."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it free?",
      "answer": "Yes for a limited time to explore, decode, and join the Circle. Paid experiences, mystery boxes, and limited event tickets may be available later for those who want to dive deeper."
