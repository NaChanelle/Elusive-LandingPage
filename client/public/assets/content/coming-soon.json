Think \"Black Mirror\" meets scavenger hunt meets cultural archive.."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is this a game or a show?",
      "answer": "\\\nBoth—and neither. It’s a living storyworld. You can watch it unfold, participate in real-world mysteries, or join the Investigator Circle to influence what happens next"

    {
      "question": "When does it launch?",
      "answer": "Our first chapter begins **August**. Early Investigators will get sneak previews, puzzle drops, and priority invites before the public."

      "question": " Do I need to be in a certain city to participate?",
      "answer": "No! While we host IRL events, much of Elusive lives online. Investigators from anywhere in the world can explore, decode, and contribute."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it free?",
      "answer": " Yes for a limited time to explore, decode, and join the Circle. Paid experiences, mystery boxes, and limited event tickets may be available later for those who want to dive deeper."
